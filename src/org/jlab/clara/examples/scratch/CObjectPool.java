 *     an object.
 *     Second constructor takes time in seconds for periodical checking of min_number_of_objects,
 *     max_number_of_objects conditions in a separate thread. When the number of objects in the
 *     pool instances is less than min, missing instances will be created. When the number of
 *     objects in the pool is greater than max, too many instances will be removed. If the
 *     checking interval  is negative, no periodical checking of min / max conditions
 *     in a separate thread take place. These boundaries are ignored then.
